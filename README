CustomBadge is a little simple iOS class to draw badges on any iOS view.
I'm sure you've seen badges before! For example on App icons when 
you received a notification. Anyway, there was never an official 
class or API from Apple to provide those badges inside an App.
For instance to put it on top of a Button. 

This is the old version 2.0 (deprecated). Please update to version 3.0.0
